# Tweetboard

### Description
The idea of the project is that when playing frisbee in college there was always someone who had to update the score on twitter during a game. 
The problem is that it can be annoying to keep up with writing tweets for every point.
This is a scoreboard that automatically updates the score on twitter for you.
